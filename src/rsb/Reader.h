/**
 * A Reader receives events published by a informers by participating
 * in a channel with a suitable scope. In contrast to the @ref
 * Listener participant, a Reader receives events using a pull-style
 * interface: the read method has to be explicitly in order to receive
 * events. This method may then block (depending on the @a block
 * parameter) until an event becomes available. The received event, if
 * any, is returned to the caller. There are no context swichtes or
 * queuing involved.
 *
 * Usage example:
 * @code
 * ReaderPtr reader = getFactory().createReader(Scope("/example/informer"));
 * reader->read();
 * @endcode
